**Field-based experiential classes – aka field courses – are critical components of undergraduate education in biodiversity focused STEM disciplines such as ecology, forestry, and wildlife management.** For example, it is in these courses that students are taught methods for monitoring environmental conditions, how to properly capture and handle wildlife, the proper way to carry out controlled burns, and how to observe and document animal behavior. They are also some of the first opportunities students have to learn how field experiments are used to test ecological hypotheses and allow them to gain experience with different taxonomic groups. These courses are where students gain the field skills and experiences needed to apply for internships, carry out independent research projects, and strengthen their applications for graduate studies. Field-based experiential learning strategies also decrease the knowledge gap between students across disciplines (Prestholdt & Fletcher, 2018) and improve the achievement and graduation rates for underrepresented groups (Beltran et al., 2020).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities canceled in-person classes and required instructors to immediately shift content delivery exclusively to online platforms. Established institutional infrastructure for online courses, along with guidance on best-practices from experienced colleagues – allowed some teachers of classroom-based courses to pivot quickly by posting video lectures online and facilitating video- or chat-based discussions. Similarly, the instructors of some lab-based courses were able to move students into the ongoing sections of previously developed online versions, or even improvise with point-of-view recordings of the experiments that students would have conducted. The instructors of field courses, however, were unable to respond as quickly or in the same way. While this was partly because of travel and social distancing restrictions imposed by institutions, the primary obstacle was a lack of models to adopt and resources to use. No one had been asked to teach a field class this way before, and hence there had been none of the development and testing of paradigms, platforms, and tools that accompanied the widespread adoption of online education (Barton, 2020).

The sudden-imposition of online instruction provides a unique opportunity for the instructors of field-based classes to identify the methods, tools, infrastructure, and resources needed to teach their students in completely new ways (Barton 2020). **Our objectives are:**

**(1)** to re-imagine the teaching of place-based courses,

**(2)** to identify tools and resources for teaching them in novel ways, especially when access to the field is limited, and make them available to teaching community, &

**(3)** to assess the factors hampering the development and adoption of novel teaching tools and methods.
