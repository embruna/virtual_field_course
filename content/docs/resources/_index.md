## Instructor Resources

The following resources are being compiled

### Video Libraries
- [streamingscience](https://streamingscience.com/): online videos, podcasts and electronic field trips in agricultural sciences
- [NEON field site visits](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLWiknuNGd50X1JAJbqQlfwKpXbtJwXFy): NEON’s field sites are spread across the US from Utqiagvik, Alaska to Guanica, Puerto Rico and over 80 sites in between. These videos provide a quick introduction to each site
- [NEON Science Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLWiknuNGd52qglw-SWvS0qJf3LdrlyWU):  animated short videos explain ecological data, concepts, or techniques
 

### Curriculum Guides
- [ESA 4DEE](https://www.esa.org/4dee/framework/): Four Dimensional Ecology Education (4DEE) Framework  
- [Evolving STEM](https://evolvingstem.org/how-it-works/) (biotech for High Schools)  
 

### Virtual and Augmented Reality Platforms

- [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/): platform for VR events
- Create interactive Virtual/360 Tours [with H5P](https://h5p.org/virtual-tour-360)
- how-to guides and other resources to get started with VR from [altvr.com](https://account.altvr.com/channels/EducatorsVR)
- workshops for educators in VR by AltspaceVR

 

### Lab Exercises, Lessons, and Course Design
- [Embracing the Paradox: Lessons Learned from Teaching Virtual Field Courses](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2020/08/31/embracing-the-paradox-lessons-learned-from-teaching-virtual-field-courses/). Post by Alicia Farmer and Stephanie Shaulskiy, University of Michigan Biological Station.
- The ESA's [EcoEd Digital Library](https://ecoed.esa.org/)
- [NEON open access teaching modules](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/teaching-modules): lesson outlines, curated datasets, and data skills activities to teach essential data skills and ecological concepts using hands-on data activities
 

### Equipment
- smartphone apps that can be used in field courses

### Games
- [Planet Zoo](https://www.planetzoogame.com/) Video game that simulates the challenges of constructing and managing a zoo
- Empires of the undergrowth ant colony management game, in a fast-paced real-time strategy style. The player excavates their nest underground, constructing tunnels and chambers to store food and raise brood. On the surface, the ants claim territory, gather resources, overwhelm fearsome arachnids and clash with other colonies.

### Participatory science platforms
- [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/): platform for participatory science research where students can be engaged in helping researchers
- [eMammal](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/emammal/emammal): Help classify camera trap photos of different animals
 

### Materials
- [VirtualBiologyLab](http://virtualbiologylab.org/) – Interactive online models for ecology, evolution and cell biology
- [LIFT – Library of Inclusive Field Technology](https://theiagd.org/lift/): From the International Association for Geoscience Diversity, the LIFT mission is to provide the tools and expertise to improve the accessibility and inclusion in university field trips and field research in the natural sciences through the use of technology aids.
- [NAGT Designing Remote Field Experiences in Geoscinces](https://nagt.org/nagt/teaching_resources/field/designing_remote_field_experie.html): gathered by educators in response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with the goals of (i) sharing expertise and existing resources and to(ii)  develop new resources to support remote or virtual capstone summer field experiences for undergraduate geoscience majors.
- [The OSU Virtual Field](https://stem.oregonstate.edu/virtual-field-mitigation-strategy-covid-19-pandemic): an NSF-funded, international collaborative that is creating virtual field experiences for university students during the pandemic
