## The Virtual Field Course 

Field-based experiential classes – aka field courses – are critical components of undergraduate education in biodiversity focused STEM disciplines such as ecology, forestry, and wildlife management. The sudden-imposition of online instruction provides a unique opportunity for the instructors of field-based classes to identify the methods, tools, infrastructure, and resources needed to teach their students in completely new ways (Barton 2020). **Our objectives are:**

**(1)** to re-imagine the teaching of place-based courses,

**(2)** to identify tools and resources for teaching them in novel ways, especially when access to the field is limited, and make them available to teaching community, &

**(3)** to assess the factors hampering the development and adoption of novel teaching tools and methods.
